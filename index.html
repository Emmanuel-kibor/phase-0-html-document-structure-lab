    My pet cat is Peter, and he is a Siamese cat. My younger brother named our cat Peter because he thought it would be funny to give our cat a human name. Most of my relatives also think that that is funny because their pet cats have names like ‘Fluffy.’ I wanted to name my cat Garfield, as the comic because I love reading Garfield comics, but now his name is Peter.
